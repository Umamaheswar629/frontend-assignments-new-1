InsuranceDB
To create DB
create database InsuranceDB
Dml crud ops-Insert/update/delete/select

Select--what you want to see
select 10,select 10+5,select productId+10 from table, select 'ram'

From--from which you are retrieving the data like source name
select * from customers;

Where--condition,col op value


Order by--must by followed by col(s)name sort criteria (ASC(default)/DESC)
we can able to use the order by without using of where
select * from emp
order by city,salary desc;
this multiple key sort  refers to first it will sort acc to city and similar city will be sorted acc to salary

Group by--Always followed by group criteria(aggeration methods)
select * from emp group by city--wrong
select count(*) from emp group by city

Having---Clause is used to apply condition over group


Limiting results
select top(5) products from prod;
OFFSET-Skip rows
FETCH NEXT --return next m rows only

Fully Qualified Names

Between --
select * from emp where salary>=2000 and salary <=50000
select * from emp where salary  between 20000 and 50000

select * from emp where city='Delhi or city='mumbai';
select * from emp where city in ('Delhi','Mumbai');


wildcards--

select * from emp where empname='A%;--it checks exact value'A%' in table
so to avoid that
select * from emp where empname like 'A%';
2.underscore '(s__)';
'[ej%]'---the first letter can be e or j


concat--
select vend_name+'('+vend_country +')'
from vendors order by vend-name;
--
Trimming function --Rtrim()-right spaces,Ltrim() only spaces can be trimmed through the trimming functions
select Rtrim()
any commands starts executing from inner side

Alias(as) is like to give the name for display like output format not for changing the structure of the schema
select sm(salary) as empsalary  from emp;

Understanding function:
Text Functions--format change like functions--Charindex(),left(),len(),str(),substr() etc--
Numeric Function--Abs(),squrt()
(*)Date and time Functions--DateAdd(),DateDiff(),DateName(),DatePart()
System Functions-@@identity

Using Aggregating Functions:


Joins----
can be done using aribitory condition
and join keyword



region--regionId(pk),regionName
dept-deptID(pk),deptname,regionId(fk);
emp-empid(pk),empname,salary,deptid(fk),mgrid(recursive fk)


1.diplay emid,empname,deptname,region name,mgrname,salary
2.disply deptname,regionname
select * from dept,region --it works background like cartesian product
select dept.deptid,dept.deptname,region.regionname from dept,region where dept.regionid=region.regionid---to avoid the cartesian product
using the joins instead of arbitory condtions:
select * from dept join region on dept.regionID=region.regionID

view-compiled sql query create view view_name as  select */required col from tabel_name--it is physical object but not the real data we can see view section in database but it not actually stored
When a new table is created from an existing table the new and old tables are independent themselves that is the changes of one table will not be reflected into the other table whereas if a view is created based on a table any changes that are performed on the table reflects into the view and any changes performed on the view reflected in the table also.
